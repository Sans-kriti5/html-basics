HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create webpages.
It tells a web browser how to display content like text, images, videos, links, and more.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of all websites. It provides the structure and layout of web pages by using tags and elements.
Think of it like the skeleton of a human body — it holds everything in place. Then CSS is like the clothes (design), and JavaScript is the brain (interactivity).
